## Project plan:
- To figure out what factors make student Dropout and Academic Success

#### Files:
- student_acadamic_analysis.ipynb -- Main code file
- final_dropandsuccess_merge.csv -- raw dataset
- pre_processed.csv and pre_processed2.csv -- two datasets that after some preprocessing
- final_clean.csv -- final dataset after all processing

#### Data Cleaning, Preprocessing (Safia) 
- Y: Electricity Net Generation (MWh)
- X: from page 1 (will need to get pivoted), Generation and Fuel Data: [Month, Quantity Consumed in Physical Units for Electric Generation, Physical Unit Label, Reported Prime Mover, Reported Fuel Type Code, Operator Name (or ID), Plant State]
- X: from Page 5: [ENERGY_SOURCE, FUEL_GROUP, QUANTITY, Average Heat Content, Average Sulfur Content, Average Ash Content, FUEL_COST, Moisture Content, Primary Transportation Mode, ]

#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing(Linda(Yuhan Lin))
- encoding for categorical variables
- Check duplicates and Delete Unnamed columns
- Test Outliers —— boxplots


#### EDA (Sharon(Ruijia GE))
- correlation matrix
- Comparising performance for Target variable
- Temporal Analysis
- Clustering using K-Means

#### Feature Engineering (Nash(Qiaoyang Lin))
- find and download Students dataset
- Box-Cox
- Create meaningful new features
- Create interactive features
- Normalization of numerical data

#### Report
- All participants to organize their process and findings in a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JRd5DeINReVoYmRqIuzUhQpY58EsFdD6B-P_0IySAcQ/edit?usp=sharing)

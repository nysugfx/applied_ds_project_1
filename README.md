## Project plan:
- To figure out what factors make student Dropout and Academic Success

#### Files:
- student_acadamic_analysis.ipynb -- Main code file
- final_dropandsuccess_merge.csv -- raw dataset
- pre_processed.csv and pre_processed2.csv -- two datasets that after some preprocessing
- final_clean.csv -- final dataset after all processing

#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing(Linda(Yuhan Lin), Safia)
- encoding for categorical variables
- Check duplicates and Delete Unnamed columns
- Test Outliers —— boxplots


#### EDA (Sharon(Ruijia GE))
- correlation matrix
- Comparising performance for Target variable
- Temporal Analysis
- Clustering using K-Means

#### Feature Engineering (Nash(Qiaoyang Lin))
- find and download Students dataset
- Box-Cox
- Create meaningful new features
- Create interactive features
- Normalization of numerical data

#### Report
- All participants to organize their process and findings in a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JRd5DeINReVoYmRqIuzUhQpY58EsFdD6B-P_0IySAcQ/edit?usp=sharing)

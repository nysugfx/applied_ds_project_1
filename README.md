## README

#### Project objective:
- Determining which factors influence student dropout and academic success rates

#### Files:
- student_acadamic_analysis.ipynb -- main code file with annotations/notes describing the process and immediate outputs
- final_dropandsuccess_merge.csv -- raw dataset
- pre_processed.csv and pre_processed2.csv -- two datasets that reflect preprocessing steps
- final_clean.csv -- final dataset (after all processing has been completed)

#### Running and reading the files:
- In order to run the code, load the .csv files into a Python reader. Alternatively, open student_acadamic_analysis.ipynb in GitHub where you can see the code and outputs.
